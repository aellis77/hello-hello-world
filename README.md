# hello-hello-world

Since my Hello World project went to bitbucket rather than here, I need to create another repo for 'hello-world',

and hence this repo 'hello-hello-world'.


Not so sure 'hello world' is right. 
Does a literary masterpiece have export control ?



Well, anyway. Node.js doesn't like message boxes, so I had to create a website to use it. 
And since I have a website, why not use the developer's console too.

So, this html,css,javascript combo, writes to the developer's console in 
your favorite browser especially if it happens to be Edge or Chrome 
(sorry, I 
could only test it in Windows Mac people), 
and also does a message box confirm and then a message box alert. 
Version 3 (current version) has an animation component. If you're on Microsoft Edge you will only
see static rotation through svg, but in Chrome, you may see the static rotation first, but then,
using some MDN experimental constructs, the text will move.



Instructions: 

  
Way A:

0. Fork this repo. 
  
  
1. Copy the helloWorld1.js, index1.html, styles1.css files to your directory of choice (or maybe clone).
  
  
2. Open your browser of choice, and find developer tools. 
    
(settings, more tools for Google chrome; settings for Microsoft Edge, not sure about others)
    
Make sure the console screen is visable.
    
  
3. Open the index1.html file in your browser (right click open in Windows usually works).
     
May see the message box before the webpage has fully loaded. 
     
   
     
Way B:
1. Copy the contents of helloWorld1.js file into a sandbox like jsFiddle or repl.it and run it. (Well, you
will miss my wacky color scheme on the website and the animation, but maybe you don't care).

Enjoy. If you're not going to delete it after using it, I would also copy the license file over.

Fair for a first program, wouldn't you say ?
