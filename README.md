# hello-hello-world

Since my Hello World project went to bitbucket rather than here, I needed to create another repo for 'hello-world',

and hence this repo 'hello-hello-world'.


Not so sure 'hello world' is right. 
Does a literary masterpiece have export control ?



Well, anyway. Node.js doesn't like alert, so I had to create a website to use it. And since I have a website, 

why not use the developer's console too.
So, this html,css,javascript combo, writes to the developer's console in 
your favorite browser (sorry, I 
could only test it in Windows Mac people), and also does a message box alert. 
Need to run more than once for the
correct sequence, in my opinion.



Instructions: 

  

0. Fork this repo. 
  
  

1. Copy the helloWorld1.js, index1.html, styles1.css files to your directory of choice (or maybe clone).
  
  
2. Open your browser of choice, and find developer tools. 
    
(settings, more tools for Google chrome; settings for Microsoft Edge, not sure about others)
    
Make sure the console screen is visable.
    
  
3. Open the index1.html file in your browser (right click open in Windows usually works).
     
May see the message box before the webpage has fully loaded, 
     
but I'd say it's pretty good for a first program.
     
     
Enjoy. If you're not going to delete it after using it, I would also copy the license file over.
